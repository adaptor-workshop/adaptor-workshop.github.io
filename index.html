<h1> Workshop on Accelerator Design As Provably correcT sOftwaRe (ADAPTOR)</h1>
<!--<p>I'm hosted with GitHub Pages.</p>-->

<h2>Home</h2>
<b>ADAPTOR</b> is the first workshop on <b>A</b>ccelerator <b>D</b>esign <b>A</b>s <b>P</b>rovably Correc<b>T</b> S<b>O</b>ftwa<b>R</b>e. It will be held as part of the 55th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO'22).

<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>We are in a golden era of rapid accelerator architecture innovations driven by emerging applications where the pure pursuit of FLOPS in hardware design with generality and abstraction is being replaced with targeted specialization. Hardware accelerators have become one of the most critical functional blocks of modern heterogeneous computer architectures. These accelerators implement domain-specific functions for machine learning and inference, edge intelligence, secure computing, and so on to improve power efficiency and computation throughput by several orders of magnitude. At the same time, the existing design practice cannot keep up with the pace of innovations due to the exponentially increasing complexity and cost. In particular, verification of functional correctness has become a major factor in design complexity and cost, and the trend is worsening.</p>

<p>This calls for a design paradigm shift including raising the level of abstraction in hardware design to software, scalable and composable verification, and a new programming model amenable for rapid verification, etc.</p>

<p>Recent work presented at MICRO/ISCA/FMCAD/PLDI/POPL and other sister conferences indicates a substantial number of researchers in the community with interests in the intersection of accelerator architecture, design, and verification.</p>
